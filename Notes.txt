In order to create the database.
From the src\Skoruba.AuditLogging.EntityFramework folder, run the following commands:
dotnet ef migrations add DbInit -c DefaultAuditLoggingDbContext -o Data/Migrations
dotnet ef database update -s ../skoruba.auditlogging.host/skoruba.auditlogging.host.csproj

The project is configured to use database AuditDB from the (localDB)\MSSQLLocalDB database.
The project is configured to use database AuditDB from the (localDB)\MSSQLLocalDB database.

If the second command doesn't succeed to create AuditDB database ( the cause is a bug in a LocalDB ), a workaround is to create the database and after that run the command again.
If you want to use an other database, you must change ApplicationDbContext connection string in appsettings.json in Host project, then run the second command.
